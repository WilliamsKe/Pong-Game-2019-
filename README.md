**Introduction**
As seen in famous movies and arcades the classic game called "Pong" will be our final project for finishing Computer Science A, this readme file will go over the functions of the project, positive and negatives of the project, what the code looks like, and lastly, the game in action. 

**Description**
Pong can be played with one person or even two! However, the project will be including two players with an objective of getting the ball past the other players paddle.  The game board is created with a line in the middle as the ball will be thrown out onto either sides of the board.  Keep in mind, the ball will go in the *opposite* direction if the ball comes in contact with the paddle or border (https://gyazo.com/e92c2ad47f19ed08acb9ca6ec780d535 <- GIF for how the ball travels).  If a player does not make contact with the ball the *other* player will recieve a point on the scoreboard and the game will reset.
